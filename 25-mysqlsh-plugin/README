They are the examples of plugin using python

The plugin folder is copied to the ~/.mysqlsh/plugins

When mysqlsh starts, it looks for all init.py (or init.js) within those ext folders in plugins

This example defines a function show_processes() to display the currently running processes, and a function kill_process() to kill a process with a specified ID. show_processes() is going to be a MySQL Shell report, and kill_process() is going to be a function provided by an extension object. 

It also registers the shell report 'sessions'
